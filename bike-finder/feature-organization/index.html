Redundant information sources
Again, another need for opinions IIII
Clear and already present reviews section and ratings list with count and clear delineations 
Common iconography 
Stick to common conventions and if we stray make it super obvious 
Maybe have a skippable site tutorial as a popup for the first time entrants of site that won’t trigger if the same IP or account logs in
Clear cut navigation with slightly different shades. Clean minimalist design with less clutter and fewer clickables per page so as to minimize confusion 
Specs should include seat configuration and weight
All specs should have the same standardized categories with an additional special features section for bikes that have features that go beyond the general spec list
Section with links to affiliate maintenance companies??

Detailed sort by with more info tabs or hoverable+clickable question marks 
Color and other practical and aesthetic customizations options right there in the site menu like the armor adjustment sites. II

Attention drawing
Imagery
Large and clear
Iconography should be both common and immediately obvious such as question marks, stars for review quality, etc.
Stick to a uniform colour scheme with varying shades for delineation as opposed to direct contrast. Maybe a few direct contrast for emphasis.
Choose colours that emphasize security, trust, stability, etc. 
Customization of products
Directly integrated into product page
On the side, as is the standard convention
Differs by product and manufacturer 
If dropshipping might be a bit difficult to fulfil but would be a cool feature.
